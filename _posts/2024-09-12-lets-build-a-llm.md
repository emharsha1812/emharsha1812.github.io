With the advent of LLMs, it has become imperative for any Machine learning engineer to understand and learn what they are and how they can be leveraged. I too want to learn about them 

This project is an effort to build a large language model from scratch, with the purpose of understanding LLMs from the ground up, how they are built, how they can be fine tuned and how can they be tinkered with

For this project I will be using the book, [Build a Large Language Model](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) from Scratch by [Sebastian Raschka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianraschka/). I will also be attaching more links that I find useful. 

The projects base repository and all the content will be posted [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/llm.md %}).
