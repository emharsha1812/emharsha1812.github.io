### Q1. What is the difference between stemming and lemmatization ?

The practical distinction between stemming and lemmatization is that, where stemming merely removes common suffixes from the end of word tokens, lemmatization ensures the output word is an existing normalized form of the word (for example, lemma) that can be found in the dictionary.
