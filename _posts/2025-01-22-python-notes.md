Hello everyone,  
Below, I am sharing the GitHub repository containing all my Python notebooks, which I created while teaching an AI-ML Ops training program to esteemed DRDO scientists. You can access the GitHub repository here: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/emharsha1812/Python_Programming_Notebooks).  

This repository is a work in progress, and I will continue to update it as I create new notebooks. Here is the current plan for upcoming content:  

1. [ ] Python One-Liners Notebook  
2. [ ] Walrus Operator in Python  
3. [ ] Building a simple project using Python  

Feel free to explore and stay tuned for updates!  

Here’s the direct GitHub link for quick access: [https://github.com/emharsha1812/Python_Programming_Notebooks](https://github.com/emharsha1812/Python_Programming_Notebooks)

Don't forget to ⭐ star the repository to stay updated with new additions!

1. [Python Iterators](https://realpython.com/python-iterators-iterables/) - A super friendly blog on Python Iterators. I recommend taking this [quiz](https://realpython.com/quizzes/python-iterators-iterables/) as well after reading the whole blog.

2. [Memory Management in Python](https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/) - One of those "You should definitely know this" topics.
