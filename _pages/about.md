Hello! My name is **Harshwardhan Fartale**, and I am currently working as a **Project Associate II** at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**.  

Previously, I served as:
- **Data Scientist** at **Bajaj Finserv Health**
- **Machine Learning Intern** at **Indian Institute of Technology, Indore**  

I earned my **Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering** from the **National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur**.

## **Research Interests**
I am deeply passionate about **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, with a particular focus on the **Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models**. My research aims to understand how these models process information and make decisions at a fundamental level.

I am actively seeking **collaborative opportunities** with fellow researchers and practitioners who share similar interests in mechanistic interpretability and are excited to explore innovative approaches in this rapidly evolving field.
