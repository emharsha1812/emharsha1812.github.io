# Hi there, I'm Harshwardhan Fartale 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Predoc Associate** at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, working at the AiREX Lab under Professor Sashikumaar Ganesan. My research focuses on developing cutting-edge **Machine Learning** systems for applications in combat aircraft.

I hold a **B.Tech in Electrical Engineering** from the National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, where I cultivated a deep passion for **Machine Learning**, **Optimization**, and **Natural Language Processing**.

In the past, I’ve worked as:
- **Data Scientist** at Bajaj Finserv Health, where I built a high-performance statistical model for fraud detection.
- **ML Intern** at IIT Indore, where I collaborated with Professor Vimal Bhatia on stock price prediction models.
- **Open Source Technical Writer** at OpenMined, contributing to documentation and tutorials for differential privacy and federated learning.

## 🔬 Key Projects

### 📄 Document Tampering Detection using YOLOv8
A forgery detection system to classify alterations (e.g., overwriting, scribbling) using YOLOv8. Built an extensive dataset of 600+ document images and designed a **Streamlit-based web interface** for user-friendly analysis.

### 👁️ Fundus AI
Developed an end-to-end system to detect ophthalmic and systemic diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract) via smartphone cameras. Integrated deep learning with **3D-printed smartphone accessories** for affordable healthcare.

### 📈 Stock Market Prediction
Implemented ML models predicting stock prices with **85% accuracy**, leveraging time series analysis and news data. Boosted model performance by **25%** through advanced feature engineering.
