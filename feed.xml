However, as I dove deep into those arcane-looking symbols, I discovered another interesting thing aside from the meaning: I realized that most of the founders of these equations were from Hungary!</p> <p>I googled, and then, a few clicks later, I stumbled on this very interesting read titled <strong>‚ÄòA Visit to Hungarian Mathematics‚Äô</strong>. Here‚Äôs the <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/math/1993-hersh.pdf">link</a> üîó to this pape . It contained exactly what I was looking for; a detailed introspection into Hungarian mathematicss and the mathematicians surrounding them. While reading the paper, I found a very simple but profoundly impactful quote that I would like to share. It says</p> <blockquote> <p>Everyone has ideas, both right ideas and wrong ideas. Scientific work consists merely of seperating them</p> </blockquote> <p>I immediately started voraciously reading the paper from top to bottom, left to right, and backwards too. Even though I am not a mathematician and do not have a mathematics degree (although I have a fairly good amount of mathematical exposure), I love to explore mathematics as a hobby. I sincerely hope that my interest in mathematics is still relevant.</p> <p>One of the key takeaways from this paper will be a quote by Alfred Renyi, a Hungarian mathematician known for his work in probability theory, combinatorics, and other fields. Once, a gifted mathematician told him that his working ability was heavily dependent on external circumstances. Renyi responded,</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm unhappy, I use math to find happiness; when I‚Äôm content, I use math to maintain my happiness.‚Äù</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Reading about these mathematicians and their passion for pondering, fighting, and finally solving math problems fills me with a deep sense of gratitude towards math.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics,culture"/><category term="mathematics,"/><category term="axioms"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why Hungarians are so darn good at mathematics ?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome!</title><link href="https://emharsha1812.github.io/blog/2024/welcome/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome!"/><published>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://emharsha1812.github.io/blog/2024/welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://emharsha1812.github.io/blog/2024/welcome/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
