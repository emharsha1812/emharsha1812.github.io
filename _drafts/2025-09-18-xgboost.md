## 1. Introduction

The objective of Boosting is to build strong learners by sequentially combining many weak learners.
Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) uses weights to identify the most missclassfied examples. Gradient Boosting uses gradients (residuals) to identify the most missclassified examples. 
The fundamental intuition behind both of these boosting methods is to target the most missclassified (worst behaving) examples at every iteration to improve classification

### Newton Boosting

Newton Boosting combines the advantages of Adaboost and gradient boosting and thus uses *weighted gradients* (or weighted residuals) to identify the most misclassified examples. 

This framework of Newton boosting can be applied to any loss functions, which means that any classification, regression or ranking problem can be boosted using weak learners. 

The fundamental motivation for devising Newton Boosting is for the optimization of the loss function. Gradient Descent is a first order optimization method, meaning that it uses first derivatives during optimization

Newtons method or newtons descent is a *second order* optimization method, such that it uses both the first derivatives as well as the second derivatives information to compute the newton step

Thus Newton boosting extends the idea of gradient boosting by also using second-order derivatives (Hessians), which encode curvature information and allow for more accurate, often faster updates.

XGBoost is a high-performance implementation that leverages Newton-style updates together with practical regularization and engineering techniques to scale tree-based boosting to large problems

---

## 2. Newton's method (optimization refresher)

Newton's method is a second-order optimization technique for minimizing scalar functions. For a scalar objective $$ f(w) $$, Newton's method uses a *quadratic approximation* around the current iterate $$ w_t $$:

* Taylor expansion to second order:

$$
f(w) \approx f(w_t) + f'(w_t)(w - w_t) + \tfrac{1}{2} f''(w_t) (w - w_t)^2.
$$

* Setting derivative of this approximation to zero gives the classical Newton update:

$$
w_{t+1} = w_t - \frac{f'(w_t)}{f''(w_t)}.
$$

Compare this to gradient descent:

$$
w_{t+1} = w_t - \alpha_t f'(w_t),
$$

where $$ \alpha_t $$ is a step size. Newton's step effectively sets an adaptive step size 
$$ \alpha_t  = 1/f''(w_t) $$ (when $$ f''(w_t) > 0 $$),
so it moves more aggressively in flat regions (small curvature) and more conservatively in sharp-curvature regions (large curvature).

In higher dimensions, $$ f'(w) $$ becomes the gradient $$\nabla f$$ and $$f''(w)$$ becomes the Hessian matrix $$H$$. The Newton update generalizes to:

$$
w_{t+1} = w_t - H^{-1}(w_t) \nabla f(w_t).
$$

### Intuition
In gradient descent, first derivative information only allows us to construct a local linear approximation at best. While this gives us a descent direction, different step lengths can give us vastly different estimates and may ultimately slow down convergence

Incorporating second-derivative information as Newton's descent does, allows us to construct a local quadratic approximation. This **extra** information leads to a better local approximation, resulting in better shapes and faster conversions



As we know, Gradient Boosting characterizes misclassified examples that need attention through residuals. A residual is simply another means to measure the extend of misclassification and is computed as the gradient of the loss function


Newton Boosting does *weighted residuals* The residuals in Newton boosting are computed using the first derivative (gradient of the loss function) while the weights are computed using the Hessian of the loss function (the second derivative)

Thus it thoroughly ensures that the misclassified examples recieve focus based on the extent of their missclassification



## 3. Newton boosting: idea and mechanics

Newton boosting adapts Newton's optimization idea to function-space boosting (i.e., iteratively building an additive model $$F(x) = \sum_{t} f_t(x)$$ where each $$f_t$$ is a weak learner such as a regression tree).

Key idea:

* At iteration $$t$$, given current model $$F_{t-1}(x)$$, approximate the loss $$\ell(y, F(x))$$ using a second-order Taylor expansion in $$F$$:

$$
\ell(y, F_{t-1}(x) + f_t(x)) \approx \ell(y, F_{t-1}(x)) + g(x)\, f_t(x) + \tfrac{1}{2} h(x)\, f_t(x)^2,
$$

where

$$
g(x) = \left.\frac{\partial \ell(y, F)}{\partial F}\right|_{F=F_{t-1}(x)}, \qquad
h(x) = \left.\frac{\partial^2 \ell(y, F)}{\partial F^2}\right|_{F=F_{t-1}(x)}.
$$

* The second-order approximation converts the problem of finding $$f_t$$ into minimizing a weighted squared-error objective:

$$
\min_{f_t} \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ g_i f_t(x_i) + \tfrac{1}{2} h_i f_t(x_i)^2 \right] + \Omega(f_t),
$$

where $$g_i$$ and $$h_i$$ denote gradient and Hessian at $$x_i$$, and $$\Omega$$ is a regularizer on $$f_t$$ (e.g., penalize tree complexity).

* If the weak learner is a regression tree that predicts constant values in leaves, then for a leaf $$j$$ with instances $$\mathcal{I}_j$$ the optimal constant prediction $$w_j$$ can be computed in closed form (see the next section). Thus tree fitting reduces to collecting aggregated $$G_j=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_j} g_i$$ and $$H_j=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_j} h_i$$ statistics and using them to evaluate candidate splits and leaf values.

So, Newton boosting trains trees on Hessian-weighted residuals $$-g_i/h_i$$ in effect, with $$h_i$$ controlling step size per-example.

---

## 4. Role of Hessians (intuition)

Why do Hessians help?

* Hessians encode curvature of the loss w.r.t. model output. If $$h_i$$ is large, the loss curvature around that example is steep; Newton's method takes smaller steps there because the quadratic term penalizes large $$f_t(x_i)$$.
* If $$h_i$$ is small, the loss is relatively flat at that point and Newton can take larger corrective steps.

Practically, weighting examples by $$h_i$$ means the algorithm adjusts the influence of each training point on split decisions and leaf values according to local curvature, often giving more stable and faster convergence than first-order methods (especially for losses where curvature varies a lot across the domain).

Note: very small $$h_i$$ values can cause instability (division by near-zero). Implementations add a $$\lambda$$ term (L2 regularization on leaf weights) to stabilize computations.

---

## 5. XGBoost: what it is and why it works well

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an efficient and scalable implementation of tree-based boosting that:

* Uses second-order (Newton) approximations for fast, accurate updates.
* Optimizes a regularized objective that directly penalizes model complexity.
* Implements efficient split finding (approximate histograms / weighted quantile sketches) and data structures (block-based storage and cache-friendly layouts).
* Provides features like parallel learning, out-of-core computation, and a range of tuning options (learning rate, $$\gamma$$, $$\lambda$$, subsampling, column sampling, etc.).

Two practical aspects that contribute heavily to XGBoost's success:

1. **Regularized objective** that makes tree leaf-value computation and split evaluation analytically tractable and robust.
2. **Engineering**: clever data layouts and parallelization allow it to scale to large datasets.

---

## 6. Regularized objective and tree algebra

XGBoost trains an additive model by minimizing a regularized objective at each boosting round. For a dataset $${(x_i, y_i)}_{i=1}^n$$ and model $$F_{t}(x) = F_{t-1}(x) + f_t(x)$$, the objective is typically

$$
\mathcal{L}^{(t)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \ell\big(y_i, F_{t-1}(x_i) + f_t(x_i)\big) + \Omega(f_t),
$$

where a common choice of the regularizer for trees is

$$
\Omega(f) = \gamma T + \tfrac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_{j=1}^{T} w_j^2,
$$

with $$T$$ the number of leaves in the tree and $$w_j$$ the weight/value predicted by leaf $$j$$; $$\gamma$$ penalizes number of leaves and $$\lambda$$ is an L2 penalty on leaf weights.

Using a second-order Taylor expansion of $$\ell$$ around $$F_{t-1}$$:

$$
\ell(y_i, F_{t-1} + f_t) \approx \ell(y_i, F_{t-1}) + g_i f_t(x_i) + \tfrac{1}{2} h_i f_t(x_i)^2,
$$

with per-example gradients and Hessians $$g_i, h_i$$ as defined earlier.

### Leaf weight derivation (closed-form)

Assume $$f_t$$ is a tree with leaves $$j=1\ldots T$$, each predicting constant value $$w_j$$. For leaf $$j$$, define:

$$
G_j = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}_j} g_i, \qquad H_j = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}_j} h_i,
$$

where $$\mathcal{I}_j$$ is the set of instance indices falling into leaf $$j$$.

Ignoring constants independent of $$w_j$$, the objective contribution from leaf $$j$$ is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_j(w_j) = G_j w_j + \tfrac{1}{2} (H_j + \lambda) w_j^2 + \gamma.
$$

Minimize w.r.t. $$w_j$$ by setting derivative to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_j}{\partial w_j} = G_j + (H_j + \lambda) w_j = 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
w_j^\ast = -\frac{G_j}{H_j + \lambda}.
$$

So the optimal leaf weight is proportional to the negative aggregated gradient, scaled by aggregated Hessian plus regularization.

The minimum objective (reduction in loss) for the leaf is

$$
\mathcal{L}_j(w_j^\ast) = -\tfrac{1}{2}\frac{G_j^2}{H_j+\lambda} + \gamma.
$$

This algebra gives two important operational formulas: the optimal leaf value and the leaf's contribution to objective reduction.

### Split gain formula

Given a node that would be split into left (L) and right (R) children, the improvement (gain) from performing that split is the difference between the parent's score and the sum of child scores:

Let $$G=G_L+G_R$$ and $$H=H_L+H_R$$. The gain is

$$
\text{gain} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\frac{G_L^2}{H_L + \lambda} + \frac{G_R^2}{H_R + \lambda} - \frac{G^2}{H + \lambda}\right) - \gamma.
$$

A split is beneficial only if `gain` is positive (or above a threshold). This formula naturally includes Hessian-weighting and L2 regularization, and the $$\gamma$$ term penalizes creating extra leaves.

---

## 7. Efficient split finding: weighted quantile sketch (conceptual)

For large datasets, exhaustively evaluating all candidate splits is expensive. Two common approximate approaches:

* **Histogram-based binning:** bin continuous feature values into a fixed number of buckets and evaluate splits only at bucket boundaries (used by LightGBM and others).
* **Quantile sketching:** approximate quantiles of feature values to pick candidate split positions. For Newton boosting, each instance has a weight (often the Hessian $$h_i$$), so the sketch must be **weighted**.

XGBoost's **weighted quantile sketch** finds approximate quantile boundaries while accounting for example weights (Hessians). The key idea is to build a compact summary of the weighted distribution of a feature and then propose split thresholds from that summary. This trades a small amount of exactness for massive gains in memory and time efficiency and allows XGBoost to scale to large data.

In practice, implementations also:

* Presort or block data for cache-friendly access
* Chunk data and operate on blocks to reduce IO overhead (important for out-of-core training)
* Use parallel reduction to compute aggregated $$G_j$$ and $$H_j$$ for candidate splits

## 8. Minimal code examples (XGBoost usage patterns)

Below are essential patterns you will commonly use. Keep these snippets minimal and idiomatic.

### Example: basic scikit-learn-style fit (classification)

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
Xtr, Xte, ytr, yte = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.1,
                             objective='binary:logistic', use_label_encoder=False)
model.fit(Xtr, ytr, eval_metric='logloss')

ypred = (model.predict_proba(Xte)[:,1] >= 0.5).astype(int)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(yte, ypred))
```

### Example: native interface with DMatrix and xgb.train

```python
import xgboost as xgb
dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(Xtr, label=ytr)
dtest  = xgb.DMatrix(Xte, label=yte)

params = {'objective': 'binary:logistic', 'max_depth': 3, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
bst = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=100)
yp = bst.predict(dtest)
```

These patterns are enough to get going. Use the scikit-learn wrapper for quick experiments; use the native `DMatrix` and `xgb.train` for more fine-grained control.

## 9. Training practices: learning rate selection, CV, early stopping

### Learning rate (shrinkage)

The learning rate $$\eta$$ scales each tree's contribution:

$$
F_t(x) = F_{t-1}(x) + \eta f_t(x).
$$

A smaller $$\eta$$ makes learning more conservative and usually improves generalization when combined with a larger number of trees. Common practice: grid-search (or log-space search) over plausible $$\eta$$ values and use cross-validation to pick the one that minimizes validation error.

Example grid-search skeleton:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

rates = np.concatenate([np.linspace(0.02, 0.1, 5), np.linspace(0.2, 1.0, 5)])
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
# loop over rates and folds, track validation scores; choose best rate
```

### Cross-validation with XGBoost

Use `xgb.cv` for fast built-in CV:

```python
import xgboost as xgb
dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(Xtr, label=ytr)
params = {'objective': 'binary:logistic', 'max_depth': 3, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
cv_results = xgb.cv(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=100, nfold=5, metrics='logloss',
                          early_stopping_rounds=10, seed=42)
print(cv_results.tail())
```

### Early stopping

Early stopping halts training once validation metric ceases to improve:

* With scikit-learn wrapper:

```python
model.fit(Xtr, ytr, eval_set=[(Xval, yval)], eval_metric='auc',
             early_stopping_rounds=5)
```

* With `xgb.cv`, use `early_stopping_rounds` as shown above.

Early stopping is an effective way to avoid wasting time on overfitting and to automatically pick a number of boosting rounds.

## 10. Case study: ranking / LETOR (setup + notes)

Learning-to-rank tasks (e.g., LETOR datasets) are a common place to apply boosting for ranking metrics. Typical setup:

* Each example is a query-document pair with features describing query, document, and query-document matches.
* Labels are relevance levels (e.g., 0/1/2).
* Use a ranking objective (XGBoost supports pairwise and listwise ranking objectives, as well as custom losses).

Basic data load pattern (LIBSVM-style features):

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_svmlight_file
X, y = load_svmlight_file('Querylevelnorm.txt')
# split data ensuring query-group consistency if needed
```

Notes for ranking experiments:

* Ensure that train/validation/test splits respect query groups (documents for a query should not be split across train/val/test in a way that leaks information).
* Evaluate with ranking metrics such as NDCG@k or MAP.
* Use randomized CV and multiple seeds for robust comparisons across XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.

---

## 11. Summary

* Newton boosting leverages second-order Taylor expansions (gradients + Hessians) to produce more informed updates than first-order gradient boosting.
* For tree-based weak learners, aggregated gradients $$G_j$$ and Hessians $$H_j$$ per leaf lead to closed-form optimal leaf weights $$w_j^\ast = -G_j/(H_j+\lambda)$$.
* XGBoost combines Newton-style updates, a regularized objective, and engineering optimizations (weighted quantile sketch, block data layout, parallelism) to scale efficiently and generalize well.
* Key practical controls: learning rate, tree depth, number of leaves, L2 regularization ($$\lambda$$), complexity penalty ($$\gamma$$), subsampling, column sampling, early stopping.
* For production/robust experiments, use cross-validation, early stopping, and multiple random seeds. Monitor both training and validation curves and prefer conservative learning rates combined with appropriate regularization.
