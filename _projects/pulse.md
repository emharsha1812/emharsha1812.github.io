# PULSE: Python Unified Library for Sensor Emulation

[PULSE](https://github.com/zenoxml/pulse) is a sophisticated Python library developed jointly by Zenteiq Aitech Innovations and the AiREX Lab at IISc Bangalore. It provides a unified interface for generating synthetic sensor data, enabling researchers and developers to simulate realistic datasets without physical hardware.


## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Sensor Coverage**: Simulate data from dozens of sensor types for testing and validation
- **High-Performance Computing**: Optimized numerical computations using JAX and NumPy
- **Configurable Parameters**: Fine-tune simulation settings for noise levels, ranges, and frequencies
- **Advanced Error Modeling**: Support for Constant, Linear, Sinusoidal, Gaussian, and Uniform error models

## Technical Implementation

PULSE leverages modern Python libraries and best practices:

- **Core Framework**: Built with Python 3.12, utilizing NumPy and SciPy
- **User Interface**: Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- **Data Management**: Efficient handling with HDF5 and YAML configuration
- **Visualization**: Dynamic plotting using Plotly

## Future Enhancements

Our development roadmap includes:

1. GPU Support for enhanced computational performance
2. Real-time simulation capabilities
3. Distributed computing support
4. Additional sensor types and domains

## Try It Out

Get started with PULSE using Conda:

```bash
conda create -n pulse_env python=3.12
conda activate pulse_env
conda install numpy scipy pandas streamlit pyyaml h5py plotly
pip install -e .
```
